                        <p class='paddit'>Hello! My name is Randall Burgess and I am a student at the UW coding boot camp program. I am very excited to
                            be taking my first foray into the coding world, and can't wait to see what's coming up for us!  I have been waiting to join the coding boot camp program for almost four years, and am ready to throw everything I have at the process.  I am well informed about what to expect, and am driven by the successes I've already seen come from these program, and am ready to join those happy people!</p>
                
                        <p class='paddit'>I'm not one to really talk about myself, so I'm not really certain what to put here.  I have been practicing rudimentary code in preparation for the course, and I have found it very enjoyable.  I do have a tech background, but in IT rather than development. I enjoy assembling my own PC's, as well as
                            tooling around with in home media networking. I also enjoy playing music, and will one day blow up the moon.
