## Description

This is my updated profile page that will be the coding world's window to my work.
I have put together pages for people to get some general information on me and my work, as well as have provided
links to other resources, that can provide further details.

## What's Inside

The webpage is comprised of:

1. The about me page
2. My portfolio page
3. A contact me page

## Deployment

Webpage can be found at this link: https://flashotfr.github.io/Homework8/

1. The user will be immediately directed to the about me page, that will provide some general information, and allow access to other pages through the navbar.  There is also a link to my resume on the page.
2. The portfolio page has links to previous homework projects we have done, as well as for project 1.  My github is also linked on this page.
3. On the contact page, people will be able to send me an email directly.  They will also find my location, email address, phone number and a link to my linkedin page.
